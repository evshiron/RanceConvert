# RanceConvert

A simple command line tool that converts `.qnt` and `.dcf` to `.png`. Original `.ppm` (P3/P7) support is deprecated.

Susie is too old and not so convenient, and fortunately the `.spi` has provided the source along with the binary. Here comes the `RanceConvert`.

This project isn't a 100% convert of the source, but it works pretty well at its aspect. And more features won't be added unless there is a need/request.

## Dependencies
