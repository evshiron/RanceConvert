# RanceConvert

A simple command line tool that converts `.qnt` to `.ppm` (P7).

Susie is too old and not so convenient, and fortunately the `.spi` has provided the source along with the binary. Here comes the `RanceConvert`.

This project isn't a 100% convert of the source, but it works pretty well at its aspect. And more features won't be added unless there is a need/request.

## How To Use

```bash

./RanceConvert *.qnt

```
